## 1. Pressure Thresholds

### Capillary Closing Pressure (Landis, 1930)

**Original Study:**
- Landis EM. "Micro-injection studies of capillary blood pressure in human skin." *Heart* 1930;15:209-228.

**Key Values:**
| Location | Pressure (mmHg) | Range |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| Arteriolar end | 32 | 18-32 |
| Capillary apex | 20 | - |
| Venous end | 12 | 6-18 |

**Verification Study:**
- Mahler F, et al. "Dynamic measurement of human capillary blood pressure." *Clin Sci* 1988;74(5):507-512. PMID: [3370917](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3370917/)
- Measured 78 capillaries in 19 subjects
- Arteriolar limb: 37.7 ± 3.7 mmHg
- Apex: 19.4 ± 1.0 mmHg
- Venular limb: 14.6 ± 0.5 mmHg

### NPIAP/EPUAP Guidelines on Thresholds

**Source:** [2019 International Clinical Practice Guideline](https://www.internationalguideline.com/2019)

**Key Points:**
- 32 mmHg is NOT a universal discriminator for harm
- Some individuals tolerate higher pressures; others cannot tolerate 32 mmHg
- Interface pressure alone is insufficient; shear and tissue deformation also critical
- No specific threshold values recommended due to individual variation

## 3. Muscle Strain Thresholds for Damage

### Strain-Time Cell Death Threshold

**Primary Study:**
- Gefen A, et al. "Strain-time cell-death threshold for skeletal muscle in a tissue-engineered model system for deep tissue injury." *J Biomech* 2008;41(9):2003-2012.
- PMID: [18501912](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18501912/)

**Key Findings:**
| Duration | Maximum Tolerable Strain (95% likelihood) |
|----------|------------------------------------------|
| 1 hour | <65% engineering strain |
| 285 minutes | <40% engineering strain |
| 6 hours | 30-50% causes <50% cell death |

**Conclusion:** At short durations (>1 h), muscle cells can withstand ~50% strain.

### Compression-Induced Damage Relationship

**Study:**
- Ceelen KK, et al. "Compression-induced damage and internal tissue strains are related." *J Biomech* 2008;41(16):3399-3404.
- PMID: [19010470](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19010470/)

**Key Finding:** Monotonic increase in damage with increasing maximum shear strain once a threshold is exceeded. Maximum shear strain is a predictive indicator of muscle damage.

### Peak Strains During Sitting (MRI + FE)

**Study:**
- Linder-Ganz E, et al. "Assessment of mechanical conditions in sub-dermal tissues during sitting: a combined experimental-MRI and finite element approach." *J Biomech* 2007;40(7):1443-1454.
- PMID: [16920122](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16920122/)

**Measured Values:**
- Peak principal compressive strain in gluteus: **74 ± 7%**
- Peak compressive stress in gluteus: **32 ± 9 kPa**

**Study:**
- Peko Cohen L, et al. "Development and evaluation of a new methodology for the fast generation of patient-specific Finite Element models." *J Tissue Viability* 2018.
- PMID: [30201252](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30201252/)

**Finding:** Maximum Green Lagrange shear strains: 213 ± 101% (high inter-individual variability)

## 4. Deep Tissue Injury Mechanisms

**Review:**
- Gefen A, Weihs D. "Pressure induced deep tissue injury explained." *Ann Biomed Eng* 2016;44(4):1250-1261.
- PMID: [25480479](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25480479/)

**Two Damage Mechanisms:**
1. **Direct deformation damage:** High strains cause cell damage within minutes
2. **Ischemic damage:** Blood vessel occlusion; takes several hours to develop

**Key Citation:**
- Oomens CW, et al. "The importance of internal strain as opposed to interface pressure in the prevention of pressure related deep tissue injury." *J Tissue Viability* 2010;19(2):35-42.
- Interface pressure alone is insufficient; internal deformations determine damage threshold.

## 5. Alternating Pressure Mattress Effectiveness

### Systematic Review

**Study:**
- Shi C, et al. "Effects of alternating pressure air mattresses on pressure injury prevention: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials." *J Tissue Viability* 2022.
- PMID: [35229980](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35229980/)

**Finding:** Insufficient evidence that APM is more effective than other surfaces, but can be used in at-risk patients.

### E²MAO Randomized Trial

**Study:**
- Beeckman D, et al. "Pressure ulcers prevention efficacy of an alternating pressure air mattress in elderly patients: E²MAO a randomised study." *Geriatr Gerontol Int* 2017.
- PMID: [28598759](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28598759/)

**Results:**
- APAM group: 6.46% cumulative PU risk
- Viscoelastic foam: 38.91% cumulative PU risk
- **Relative reduction: ~83%**

### Belgian Nursing Home RCT

**Study:**
- Vermette S, et al. "A multicentre prospective randomised controlled clinical trial comparing the effectiveness and cost of a static air mattress and alternating air pressure mattress." *Int J Nurs Stud* 2019.
- PMID: [31234104](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31234104/)

**Results:**
- Static air mattress: 5.2% PU incidence
- Alternating pressure: 11.7% PU incidence
- Static performed better in this nursing home population

### PRESSURE 2 Trial

**Study:**
- Nixon J, et al. "Comparing alternating pressure mattresses and high-specification foam mattresses." NIHR HTA 2019.
- [NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK547035/)

**Finding:** No evidence of difference between APM and high-spec foam in meta-analysis of 10 trials.

## Limitations and Gaps

1. **Scapula tissue thickness:** Limited peer-reviewed data specific to pressure injury risk
2. **Occiput tissue thickness:** Insufficient imaging studies for normative values
3. **Individual variation:** All values show significant inter-individual variability
4. **Population specificity:** Most studies on Western populations; may not generalize
