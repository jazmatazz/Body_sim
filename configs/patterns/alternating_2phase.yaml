# Two-Phase Alternating Pressure Pattern
# Classic checkerboard alternating pressure for pressure ulcer prevention

pattern:
  name: "Two-Phase Alternating"
  type: alternating
  description: |
    Classic checkerboard alternating pressure pattern commonly used in
    medical alternating pressure mattresses. Cells alternate between
    inflated and deflated states in a checkerboard pattern, switching
    every half-cycle.

  # Timing
  cycle_duration: 10.0  # Seconds for complete cycle
  transition_time: 0.5  # Seconds to transition between phases

  # Height levels (normalized 0-1)
  levels:
    high: 1.0           # Fully inflated
    low: 0.3            # Partially deflated (never fully flat)

  # Phase definitions
  phases:
    - name: "phase_a"
      duration: 5.0     # First half of cycle
      pattern_type: "checkerboard"
      primary_cells: "even"  # Cells where (row + col) % 2 == 0
      primary_height: high
      secondary_height: low

    - name: "phase_b"
      duration: 5.0     # Second half of cycle
      pattern_type: "checkerboard"
      primary_cells: "odd"   # Cells where (row + col) % 2 == 1
      primary_height: high
      secondary_height: low

# Clinical notes
clinical:
  indication: "Pressure ulcer prevention"
  recommended_for:
    - "Patients at moderate risk for pressure injuries"
    - "General pressure redistribution"
  cycle_rationale: |
    10-second cycle provides regular pressure relief while maintaining
    adequate support. Faster cycles may cause discomfort, slower cycles
    may not provide sufficient relief.
