# Zone-Based Pressure Relief Pattern
# Independent control of body region zones

pattern:
  name: "Zone-Based Pressure Relief"
  type: zone
  description: |
    Advanced pattern with independent control of different body regions.
    Allows targeting high-risk areas (sacrum, heels) with more aggressive
    pressure relief while maintaining stable support in other areas.

# Clinical notes
clinical:
  indication: "High-risk patients with specific pressure points"
  recommended_for:
    - "Patients with existing sacral pressure injuries"
    - "Patients with heel pressure concerns"
    - "Post-surgical patients with limited mobility"
  notes: |
    - Heel zone maintained at high pressure to minimize contact
    - Sacral zone has most aggressive alternating pattern
    - Phase offsets prevent simultaneous deflation of adjacent zones
