# Wave Propagation Pattern
# Sinusoidal wave traveling along mattress length

pattern:
  name: "Wave Propagation"
  type: wave
  description: |
    Sinusoidal wave pattern that travels from head to foot (or reverse),
    creating a massage-like effect while redistributing pressure.
    Useful for promoting circulation and comfort.

  # Timing
  cycle_duration: 20.0  # Seconds for wave to complete one pass

  # Wave parameters
  wave:
    direction: "head_to_foot"  # Options: head_to_foot, foot_to_head
    wavelength: 4.0            # Cell units (longer = gentler wave)
    amplitude: 0.35            # Height variation (0-0.5)
    baseline: 0.65             # Base height level (0-1)

  # Optional bidirectional mode for massage effect
  bidirectional:
    enabled: false
    secondary_wavelength: 6.0
    phase_offset: 0.5

# Clinical notes
clinical:
  indication: "Circulation promotion and comfort"
  recommended_for:
    - "Patients who can tolerate gentle movement"
    - "Extended bed rest without high pressure injury risk"
  contraindications:
